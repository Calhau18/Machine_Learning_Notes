# Machine Learning Notes

This text is essentially a summary of some essential knowledge in Machine Learning and does not aim to go into detailed explanations of the concepts covered.
The main objective of this document is hence to be a reference, and not to clarify.
However, some topics are accompanied by brief explanations, in order to remind the intuition behind them.

This text was made by the author while in preparation for both its Bachelor Machine Learning course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico @ Lisbon, Portugal and its Master Machine Learning course at EPFL @ Lausanne, Switzerland, also with some consultation of Standford's online content.
Be advised that the content does not coincide exactly with neither of these courses and may be presented in different fashion from them.

Contributions, orrections and suggestions are welcome at [the document's repo](https://github.com/Calhau18/Machine_Learning_Notes).
